# Creation of a Power BI dashboard to visualise and monitor projects
# I. Context
I carried out a data visualisation consulting mission for Sanitorial, an international company that develops and sells oral care products.

The company required a dynamic dashboard to track the progress of ongoing projects, identify delays, and monitor performance. The goal was to provide clear, actionable insights to help teams take appropriate corrective measures when needed.

The dashboard needed to support three user roles, each with different levels of access : CEO, Regional Manager and Country Manager.

# II. Methodology
## 1. Product Strategy canvas
To ensure a clear understanding of the clientâ€™s needs, I began by:

- Creating a Product Strategy Canvas, using a provided template.

- Writing user stories for each role to define their objectives, responsibilities, and the level of data access required.

This helped ensure alignment between the technical development of the dashboard and the business goals of each user profile.

## 2. Data Preparation
Next, I worked on preparing the data for analysis:

- Loaded data into Power Query Editor for transformation and cleaning.

- Linked tables to enable cross-analysis between datasets.

- Designed a star schema data model, organising the data warehouse for optimal performance and clarity.

## 3. Dashboard Development
I then developed the interactive Power BI dashboard with the following features:

- Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key metrics and detect project delays or budget overruns.

- Configured row-level security to define user access permissions according to their role (CEO, Regional Manager, or Country Manager).

- Built visualisations of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as: Project status (on track, delayed, or over budget), Budget vs actuals, Completion rates per region/country.

## 4. Presentation of Results
Finally, I presented the dashboard to the project manager, clearly linking each part of the dashboard to her strategic objectives. I demonstrated how the visualisations support real-time monitoring and informed decision-making.
